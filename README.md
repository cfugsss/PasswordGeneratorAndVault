# PasswordGeneratorAndVault
This program generates a random 12 digit/character password (upper and lowercase) and stores it in a file along with your username and app/website.

# Description

Made this because I cant remember a password for more than 3 minutes. Functionality I want to add in the future is saving the password,
username, and app as a list in a new file so the program can retrieve your information without you going to the file. For now you get a
nice sentance including your password, username, and sitename/app in the text file. Passwords are also not encryped so.
