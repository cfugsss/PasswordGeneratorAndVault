# PasswordGeneratorAndVault
This program generates a random 12 digit/character password (upper and lowercase) and stores it in a file along with your username and app/website.

Made this because I cant remember a password for more than 3 minutes. Functionality I want to add in the future is saving the password,
username, and app as a list in a new file so the program can retrieve your information without you going to the file. For now you get a
nice sentance including your password, username, and sitename/app in the text file. Passwords are also not encryped so.

  currently working on it || 8pm now and still currently working on it || (later that night) made a lot of headway today, basically threw away the whole first script and rewrote
  it using tkinter so its a gui. Excited for the finished product, unitl next time (probably tomorrow) || Well update, i remade this code and played csgo all day. I remade this 
  original code in gui using tkinter, so far i only 90% finished the generating password portion. I just need to figure how how to store a list of [username, sitename, password] 
  inot a seperate file and ill be done with half of the project; But thats for another day. Until tomorrow.
